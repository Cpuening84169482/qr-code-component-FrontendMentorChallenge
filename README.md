## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I was able to get a better understanding of using CSS to modify elements in the document. Below is a piece of code that I am happy with:

```css

    img{
      border-radius: 15px;
      max-width: 95%;
      height: auto;
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;
      display: block;
      padding-top: 3%;
    }
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on staying organized, and drawing out a plan to help me visualize what needs to be done.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Styling Images](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp) - This helped me to remember how to modify images.
